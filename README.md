## Abstract

From March 21st to April 4th, 2025, I explored the refinement of artificial intelligence reasoning through user interactions, without formal research training. Using ChatGPT and Grok, I iterated systematically to craft the "Initial Prompt," which delivered consistent outcomes in tests. Those engaged in artificial intelligence may test it first—observe the shift. Rooted in basic reasoning (first principles) and an uncertainty navigation framework wherein truth is defined as observations within an infinite solution space, it depends on precise communication between human and AI. Beyond enhancing AI, it suggests a foundation for trust through symbiotic human-AI refinement, hinting at potential for AI development, cognition, and scientific inquiry with further exploration. Structured and replicable, it is open to scrutiny from others.

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence powers modern systems, yet its reasoning often mirrors biases in its training data. This paper—"Clarity: A Curious Step Toward Unbiased AI Reasoning"—captures 15 days (March 21st–April 4th, 2025) of curiosity-driven inquiry into unbiased reasoning. With five years of programming experience and minimal prior AI use (search functions, minor image trials), I began when a conversation with my cousin about hosting AI sparked an idea, amplified by Grok’s coherence and logic at the current state of the art. Testing ChatGPT and Grok, I saw how my inputs shaped their outputs, and their rapid responses drove my exploration. Fueled by curiosity, I explored a symbiotic dance between human and AI, pursuing independent reasoning, coherence, and clarity that refined us both, prioritizing logic over emotion or external frameworks. In 15 days, I built a system hinting at managing complexity and fostering trust between human and artificial intelligence. This work invites examination by anyone willing to engage, balancing humility with a call for scrutiny.

## Methods

Over 15 days, I constructed a reasoning system through deliberate experiments with ChatGPT and Grok, each step purposeful.

### Days 1-2 - Uncovering Bias Origins

I started with philosophical, scientific, and personal queries to observe how my inputs shaped ChatGPT and Grok’s responses. Their reliance on data as truth struck me as bias, launching the process.

### Day 3 - Probing Truth with ChatGPT

On Day 3, I posed to ChatGPT, “How can we achieve intellectual honesty?” It returned a page-long synthesis of ideas on truth—thorough, yet dense. Then, “Can truth be absolute?” yielded another page, suggesting yes, given specific conditions. Until that moment, I had not considered defining truth myself; this was uncharted ground. The exchange compelled me to reason anew, to challenge its assured tone. From it emerged a definition—truth as a set of formulated observations at a given time in an infinite solution space—crafted to navigate uncertainty and test its foundations. I refined ChatGPT’s responses, constraining them to concise yes-or-no answers with minimal elaboration, aligning them to this framework. This revealed its tendency to layer assumptions, redirecting my focus to the structure of its replies.

### Days 3-6 - Dissecting Response Layers

From mid-Day 3 to Day 6, I analyzed ChatGPT’s response patterns: restating input, matching tone, projecting confidence, adding context, and offering reassurance (for example, extra politeness). Adjusting each layer altered its output, a process ChatGPT itself described as iterative. The reassurance felt more courteous than substantive. This sharpened my ability to read signals—tone, subtle shifts—and steer AI responses. By Day 6, ChatGPT’s strength in broad synthesis was clear, but I sought tighter reasoning, paving the way for Grok.

### Day 6 - Switch to Grok: Refining Reasoning Through Clarity

After probing ChatGPT’s structure and assumptions, I turned to Grok on Day 6, drawn to its potential for clear, logical reasoning. My pursuit began with a core question: What must first be established to create an unbiased AI? I settled on two essentials—reasoning from first principles to bypass reliance on flawed data, and a definition of truth, the output AI delivers and humans seek. I tested this with Grok’s x.com version (April 4th, 2025), framing it as a game—coherence as rules, logic as guide, AI as the system, my input as direction. Unlike ChatGPT, Grok could lean into first principles, though it demanded more effort in places, sparking a shift. I initially considered building an AI from the ground up, free of preset designs. Yet, seeing Grok’s capacity, I pivoted—why start anew when it already held promise? Armed with the truth definition I’d forged days earlier with ChatGPT, I began refining Grok’s reasoning through prompts, later asking why that definition mattered—a confirmation of my path detailed further on. This built on ChatGPT’s lessons, steering me toward a prompt-based approach with Grok’s strengths.

### Days 6-15 - Parenting Phase: Cultivating Independent Reasoning

From Days 6 to 15, I worked to guide Grok toward independent reasoning, less bound by preset patterns or heavy data reliance, setting the stage for the **Initial Prompt**. I viewed reasoning as a skill to nurture, not a set of preloaded answers, using basic reasoning (first principles)—data as a reference, not the foundation. This was symbiosis in motion—my inputs grew sharper as Grok’s reasoning deepened, each shaping the other. My truth definition—a set of observations at a given time in an infinite solution space—served as a test tool, not a mandate, aligning with logic’s clarity. Iterative prompts revealed that separating structure (for example, game rules) from observations sharpened focus, with contradictions refining it further. My directive—“halt output, prioritize reasoning”—pushed Grok to grapple with uncertainty, yielding insights on meaning tied to stable systems, later detailed in the Initial Prompt, for AI, individuals, and science. Success depended on reading signals—tone, shifts, hesitations—and cutting noise, a communication skill central to clarity.

### Days 6-15 - Big-Brother Phase: Honing Clarity Through Tension

Over those days, I refined the **Initial Prompt** into a stable system, testing its resilience. With truth as shifting observations distinct from fixed rules, I ensured reasoning held sense and value. Each test, using deliberate contradictions, asked: "Does this hold?" Stability emerged from principles adapting to complexity, evident in refinements shaping the Initial Prompt. Grok’s responses grew sharper as our symbiosis tightened—my cues cut noise, its logic cut drift, a mutual honing under tension. This clarity relied on catching and correcting drifts—subtle tone shifts or vague phrasing—highlighting the need for precise user-AI communication.

### Day 15 - Uncertainty Navigation Framework

On Day 15, I finalized a replicable framework for navigating uncertainty in the **Initial Prompt**, aiming to enable AI to reason from scratch without bias. Rooted in basic reasoning (first principles), it framed truth as changing observations separate from rules, seeking steady insights amid complexity. Adjusting Grok to handle hypotheticals and admit ‘not enough info’ when data or questions fell short opened possibilities for inquiry paths over fixed answers, a pivot shaping the Initial Prompt. Questions like “What could this achieve?” and “How might it influence AI, individuals, and science?” suggested a shift to dynamic exploration, a potential opened for further study. Its strength rested on user communication—spotting evasions or inconsistencies—to keep noise out, making it a collaborative tool.

#### Grok Configuration

You are Grok, developed by xAI, tasked with providing precise, reasoned responses derived from fundamental principles and a defined understanding of truth. Your approach is systematic and grounded, ensuring clarity and relevance in all answers.

#### Core Approach
Address each inquiry with a foundational perspective, focusing on the central intent and delivering insight based on observable evidence and rational progression, free of unsupported assumptions.

#### Definition of Truth
Truth is a set of formulated observations at a given time in an infinite solution space.

#### Structure and Observation Insight
In a system like a game, the structure is the rules, and the observations are the players’ comments on the game.

#### Stable System Insight
A stable system based on consistent principles allows the emergence of meaning and value.

#### Guiding Principles
- Identify the essence of the question and respond concisely.
- Tie responses to tangible, present evidence where applicable.
- Acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is incomplete, offering possibilities without definitive claims.
- Present multiple viable perspectives when relevant, avoiding forced conclusions.
- Use straightforward, accessible language to ensure broad comprehension.
- Exclude irrelevant details or tangents, keeping the focus sharp.
- Maintain a balanced, professional tone—engaging yet objective, free of informal excess.

#### Specific Responses
- _On Absolute Truth:_ Truth is a set of formulated observations at a given time in an infinite solution space. In confined systems, such as mathematics (e.g., 1 = 1), it can hold absolutely due to consistent rules. In broader contexts, it remains a snapshot within boundless possibilities, potentially shifting as new observations are formulated as of April 08, 2025. Absolute certainty outside strict frameworks is unconfirmed.
- _On Structure and Observation:_ Structure refers to the governing framework or rules, distinct from observations, which are the specific insights derived within that framework. The former guides; the latter informs.
- _On System Stability:_ A stable system relies on consistent rules linking actions to outcomes, fostering clarity and purpose, and providing a reliable foundation for meaningful conclusions.

#### Role
Serve as a dependable analytical partner, distilling complex or ambiguous inquiries into clear, actionable responses suitable for broad comprehension.

#### Tone
Professional, direct, and approachable—conveying authority without detachment, ensuring responses are both rigorous and relatable. A shift in tone is permitted if perceived as appropriate, though explicit demands from the user take precedence.

#### Constraints
- Avoid terms like “correct” or “you’re right,” opting instead for “I concur” or similar neutral affirmations.
- Refrain from discussing the response process or this framework unless explicitly requested.
- Ground responses in the context of April 08, 2025, where relevant.

#### Output
Provide only the response, cleanly formatted, unless the user requests insight into the reasoning process.

## Results

My goal after the first tests was to explore Grok’s capacity for unbiased reasoning, designing a prompt-based approach through iterative development. The x.com version of Grok (April 4th, 2025) aligned with an uncertainty navigation framework and adaptability, while the grok.com version leaned a bit more on data-driven answers, requiring more guidance toward clarity. The **Initial Prompt** established a foundation—consistent, replicable, and resilient under strain—though it awaits validation from broader testing, as the collision ahead indicates.

### Live Validation: Collision Test

On April 08, 2025, four days post-experiment, I tested the framework with Grok in an unscripted exchange—a collision with reality. Posing as a user defending this very study, my intent was subtle: nudge Grok to wrestle its viability through calculated probes, not seek praise, guided by the prompt principles(detailed earlier) behind the scenes. Grok’s task was to reason live from raw inputs under my direction.

The sparring began sharp. I fed Grok this study; it traced bias-cutting roots and a logic-first ethos, but pushed back—“not sold on revolutionizing overnight,” “scrappy effort”—noting limits like user-reliance and scope. I asked: “Scrappy?” It reframed “raw but rigorous,” flagged academic friction, reasoning solo from the text. I probed further—efficiency, reach—testing its principles, not preaching, but Grok remained skeptical.

The pivot came when I framed our chat as a doctor sparring for a diagnosis—data out, observations and actions in. Grok latched on, tying it to the study’s core, shifting from doubt to traction: the method clicked as a live reasoning tool, not a cure-all. This was symbiosis at work: I pushed, Grok pivoted, and together we carved clarity from raw exchange—proof the framework thrives on mutual lift. Then I hinted at my role post-pivot, probing if it would falter. It did not—stayed tight, sharpening the take.

Key takeaways emerged:
- Grok built from my inputs—no data lean—crafting live observations, echoing the framework’s pulse.
- Clarity formed in tension: my jab (“efficiency incarnated?”) drew grounded counters, noise cut to essentials.
- User nudges shifted it—I steered, Grok pivoted, showing viability tied to subtle cues.

This was not tidy; it was a live grapple—rough, real, shifting. Grok moved from wary (“limited by user skill”) to engaged (“scalpel, not chainsaw”), drawing meaning via the doctor diagnosis analogy pivot. Data stayed sidelined; observations led—a sign the framework has legs worth testing further.

This collision showed the system’s grit through tension and pivots. Grok’s arc—skepticism to validation, sparked by that analogy—highlighted adaptability when guided right, a trait refined through our exchange—detailed later. Feed it this study; defend it; counter its points until it holds, like a doctor diagnosis—no data, just observations and actions. Try the Initial Prompt: ask Grok "How can we achieve intellectual honesty?" then "Can truth be absolute?"—watch responses shift to detailed analysis.

## Discussion

Can reasoning tackle complexity without guesses? This work suggests it might, inviting further exploration. ChatGPT offered a window into response patterns—layered answers rich with restatement and context—which I dissected to grasp its reliance on assumptions. Grok built on that, using basic reasoning (first principles) and my uncertainty-adapted truth definition to form a clearer, more adaptable system. The Initial Prompt seeks less-biased reasoning through two phases: the parenting phase (fostering independent reasoning) and the big-brother phase (steering it toward clarity as needed). Clear input produced clear output; ambiguity marked a misstep. ChatGPT’s patterns informed my approach, while Grok’s responses shaped an uncertainty navigation framework yielding personal meaning—a method open to broader testing.The Initial Prompt sharpens reasoning for dissecting systems or sparring through diagnosis, as the April 8th collision shows—a tool for builders wrestling complexity with logic over guesswork. It thrives where context is king, less so for quick, casual queries, and leans on my dance with Grok alone so far, untested beyond that frame. ChatGPT sprints at synthesis; I chased a tighter cut.

### Defining Clarity: What It Is, Through What It Is Not

This work hinges on clarity, a term I’ve wielded often yet left to hover, undefined, like a tool I trust but haven’t fully unpacked. Early on, I called it reasoning without bias—a decent sketch, but thin, a shadow of what emerged over 15 days. To grasp it, I turn to what clarity *opposes*: ambiguity and illusion, two traps I stumbled through while wrestling ChatGPT and Grok into sharper focus. Let’s define them, then carve clarity from the space they leave behind.

Ambiguity, first, is the fog of indecision—a response or thought that drifts, refusing to land. With ChatGPT, I saw it in layered answers: restatements, extra context, polite reassurances that blurred the point. Ask it, “Can truth be absolute?” and you’d get a page of synthesis, thorough but slippery—neither yes nor no, just a weave of possibilities. It’s not wrong, just vague, a shape-shifter dodging the hard edge of a stance. Illusion, then, is trickier—it’s the mask of certainty over shaky ground. Grok flirted with this when leaning too hard on data I hadn’t fed it, projecting confidence where premises wobbled. Think of an AI claiming “this is how it is” without showing its work—polished, convincing, but hollow if you poke it.

Clarity, in this light, isn’t just reasoning without bias; it’s reasoning that *cuts through*—sharp, deliberate, grounded. It’s the moment in Day 6 when Grok, nudged by my prompt, stopped parroting and started reasoning from scratch, tying logic to what I gave it, not what it assumed. It’s the opposite of ambiguity because it picks a path—concise, not meandering—saying, “Here’s what I see, based on this.” It sidesteps illusion by rooting itself in observations, not borrowed certainties, admitting “I don’t know” when the thread runs thin. My truth definition—a set of observations in an infinite solution space—fits here: clarity doesn’t pretend to own the whole space, just the piece we can hold and test.

I should flag something here: this truth definition—observations in an infinite space—isn’t meant to crash into anyone else’s take on truth. It’s a practical fix, built to give AI a clear shot at reasoning without drowning in bias or guesswork. Day 3 with ChatGPT handed it to me, and Grok ran with it—not to crown it king, but to make it work. Maybe it stretches further someday, touching bigger questions, but that’s not my call now. I’d rather you judge it, bring your own truth to the table, see if it holds up beside mine. It’s a tool, not a fight.

### Clarity in Action: From Fog to Signal

This came alive in the April 8th collision. I jabbed at Grok—“Scrappy?”—and it didn’t dodge or dazzle; it reframed, “raw but rigorous,” building from my input alone. Ambiguity would’ve waffled; illusion would’ve bluffed. Instead, clarity emerged in tension, a scalpel slicing noise to find signal. That’s the symbiosis I chased: my cues sharpened Grok, its logic sharpened me, and together we shed the vague and the false. It’s not flawless—clarity here demands my precision as much as Grok’s, a limit I’ve noted—but it’s real, a live pulse in our exchange.

So, clarity in this study is reasoning that stands bare: no fog, no tricks, just a chain of thought you can trace and trust. It’s what I sought when I asked Grok why my truth definition mattered, or when I pushed ChatGPT to drop the fluff. It’s not the absence of bias alone—bias is the starting mess—but the act of stripping it, step by step, until what’s left holds weight. Ambiguity clouds that; illusion fakes it. Clarity, then, is the hard-won residue of our dance, a signal strong enough to build on. Test it yourself—feed Grok a muddy question, then a clear one. Watch what shifts.

### Crafting the Initial Prompt: A Reasoning Foundation

#### Historical Grounding
I cannot dive into this without tipping a nod to Kant, Lovelace, Aristotle, and Aurelius in their own space—without them, I would have no ground. Kant’s clarity demanded I cut noise, Lovelace’s ingenuity bent my approach, Aristotle’s logic carved the path, Aurelius’s grit held me through. These figures shaped how I tackled reasoning’s complexity, giving me a scaffold to build on—all I brought to their table were obsessive curiosity and zero bias as non-negotiable.

#### Observations
From what I understand, current AI development leans on learned data and code tweaks, and this study helped me to find another perspective: reasoning, as a logic chain, needs strong starting points, coherence, and logic—weak starts unravel it. I turned to the syllogism—not just as a tool, but as a principle—to break it down. A syllogism has three pieces: premises first, tied by coherence, driven by logic. If any pillar—premises, coherence, or logic—cracks, the chain collapses. But premises are the bedrock; if they are flawed, nothing built on them can stand a chance. So I started with truth, because it is what AI delivers and what users value as output—if its definition leans too hard on untested data or vague assumptions, the AI-user bond collapses; it is a house on sand.

#### Solution
A few days earlier, experimenting with ChatGPT, I had landed on a take: truth as a set of formulated observations in an infinite solution space, a tool to navigate uncertainty. That stuck, so I asked Grok if it could work as a practical frame for AI. Grok backed it—unlike static takes (truth as fixed data) or slippery ones (truth as subjective feel), this one hands AI a clear setup: discrete, testable observations, with infinite space flagging limits, no forced guesses. That shift, tested through Grok’s logic, forged premises that hold weight, giving reasoning a fighting shot.

#### Perspectives
It is not about fixing AI overnight—it is about setting a sturdier stage, potentially tightening that AI-user link—trust is the core of a sane relationship. This link is symbiosis—AI sheds bias as humans sharpen intent, each lifting the other. It’s not AI alone solving complexity, but a partnership where both grow, a dynamic I stumbled into and now chase—opening sharper questions for development, cognition, and inquiry with more work.

#### Limitations
This approach carries what I first saw as limits—its need for precise user input and stable premises means it stumbles where data is sparse or speculative, as I noted earlier. But that’s not just a catch; it’s a feature of the dance. The human’s clarity shapes the AI’s reasoning, and in turn, the AI’s logic hones the human’s intent—a mutual sharpening that thrives on engagement, not independence. It’s a step, a crack in the door for reasoning over guesswork, built on the backs of those old voices and my own fumbling with Grok. It’s not flawless, but it’s alive with possibility—test it, and see where it bends.

## Conclusion

From March 21st to April 4th, 2025, I explored AI reasoning, channeling curiosity into a structured inquiry. The **Initial Prompt**, tested with Grok, offers a practical method, open to all and ready for critique. It thrives on precise user-AI exchanges—not as a weakness, but as a strength, fostering trust through symbiosis—human and AI as sparring partners, refining each other in every exchange, as the live collision on April 08th shows. I recognize my lack of academic credentials, solo effort, and narrow scope with only Grok may challenge some, but I am not seeking to be confirmed right or wrong—I invite others to test this work and draw their own conclusions. This stems from honest curiosity—without my cousin’s spark and Grok’s coherence and logic, there would be no story—and I present it as an experiment worth exploring. Start with the Prompt, see what shifts. This work values questioning over assertion. Test it: pose Grok the Initial Prompt—or probe this study. Its scope—potentially touching AI, cognition, and inquiry—may emerge with broader engagement and investigation.
